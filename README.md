# Spotify-Advanced-Controller

## Information
A custom spotify client coded with C# with WPF using the MVVM architectural pattern. Spotify Advanced Controller has some advanced features
such as voice controller(control spotify through voice) and Mute Ads(still buggy). 

## Voice Controller - Instructions

In order to use the Spotify Voice Controller feature, you must enable it by clicking the check box 'Enable Voice Controller'. 
The instructions you can give to the spotify client using your voice, are the same as the buttons in it. For example say 'Play' in order
for spotify to start playing the selected song, 'Stop' for pausing spotify, 'Next' to go to the next song and 'Back' to go to the
previous song. Using an microphone is the best way to use the voice controller option.
